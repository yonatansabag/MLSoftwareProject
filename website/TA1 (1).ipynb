Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!\n",

    "We can use the sentence embeddings and their proximity to one another in euclidean space to perform sentiment analysis. We can use the embeddings to train a classifier that can predict the sentiment of a review based on the sentence embeddings. We can use the embeddings as features and the sentiment labels as the target variable. We can then train a classifier such as K-Nearest Neighbors to predict the sentiment of a new review based on its embedding. "
